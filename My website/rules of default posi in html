1. content is everything
inline will take req space only and block will take whole line
2. order comes from code
order of elem displayed is in order of code of elem written
3. children sit on top of parent
div
    h1 ....span .. /span  .... /h1
/div

h1 is child of div - it is on top of div elem, ie top on z axis of screen, ie closer to user and away form screen.
