block display elements - cover whole width (whole line and blocks other elements to be on same line)
some are:
h1 to h6
p
list(ordered and unordered)  and list items(li)
forms
div

span tag
used to stylepart of some tag differently

inline display elements - cover/use only required amount of width and does not block other elements( encourages them to be on same line)
some are:
spans 
images  img
anchors  <a>

when applied CSS 
for inline elem - we cannot change it's width and can use on same line
for block - we can change/set it's width. and cannot use in same line

display property in CSS
we can make block elem behave as inline by
p{
    display: inline;
}
now will use req space and encourages other elem to be on same line

vice versa can be done with inline elem

Inline-block display elem
can change width(block) and use on same line(inline)
p{
    display:inline-block;
}
img is inline-block elem

None display
used in css 
{
    display: none;
}
makes the elem disappear completely.

CSS property 
visibility: hidden;
makes elem hidden, it uses the space, but is hidden.
